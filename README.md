# ft_printf

Replicate the libc ``printf`` function.

No bonuses.

## Tests

You can run the tests with ``bash test.sh``, they will show the difference between the two results, the real ``printf`` result being on the left.  
If you want to see the full result files you can run ``bash test.sh f``.

These tests are compiled with ``-Wall -Wextra -Werror``, if you want **more** tests with warning disabled, run ``bash test_all.sh``.
